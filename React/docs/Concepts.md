### Components: 
 - React is built around the concept of components, which are reusable and independent building blocks of a user interface. Components encapsulate the logic and presentation of a specific part of the UI.

### JSX: 
 - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. It enables you to define the structure and content of React components in a more declarative manner.

### Virtual DOM: 
 - React utilizes a virtual representation of the actual DOM called the Virtual DOM. It's a lightweight copy of the real DOM, which React uses to efficiently update and render components. React's reconciliation algorithm compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM and applies the necessary changes to achieve optimal performance.

### State: 
 - State represents the data that can change within a component. It allows components to manage and track changes over time. State is typically declared in a component's constructor and can be updated using the setState() method. When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component.

### Props: 
 - Props (short for properties) are read-only data that are passed from a parent component to its child components. Props allow parent components to communicate and pass data to their children, enabling a top-down data flow in React.

### Lifecycle Methods: 
 - React provides lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle. These methods, such as componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount(), enable you to perform actions when a component is created, updated, or destroyed.

### Hooks: 
 - Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to add state and lifecycle functionality to functional components. They provide a simpler and more flexible approach to managing state and using lifecycle methods without the need for class components.

### Conditional Rendering: 
- React allows you to conditionally render components or content based on certain conditions. You can use conditional statements and expressions, such as if statements or the ternary operator, to dynamically control what gets rendered.

### Event Handling: 
 - React provides a straightforward way to handle user interactions and events within components. You can attach event handlers to elements using JSX syntax and define functions to respond to those events.

### React Router: 
  - React Router is a popular library for handling client-side routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes and navigate between different views or components without reloading the entire page.
